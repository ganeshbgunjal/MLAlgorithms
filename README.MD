This repository contains machine learning algorithms and practice of code. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Linear Regression:- first algorithm is Linear regression. 
we have boston price dataset for EDA and model building. 
we calculated r2 score and built very simple model.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Logistic regression:- we have taken Iris dataset for clasification. 
it has 3 variables. therefore it is multiclass classification problem. 
we load dataset, checked for null values. 
then perform train_test_split
then by using various parameters, we done hyperparamter tuning and find out which paramter is best. 
and then found out best score and also checked correlation.
